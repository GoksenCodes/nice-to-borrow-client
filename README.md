# NICE TO BORROW CLIENT

Nice to borrow is an application that allows users to search for a book by its title, by language and by the distance and send a borrow request to the book owner. You don’t have to wait to travel to your hometown or wait for a visitor anymore to enjoy the books in your language.

### Goals for this project
The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app by using technologies I've learned during full-stack web developer bootcamp and using new technologies and libraries that I learned by reading documentation and watching tutorial videos.

The app is still a work in progress with a clear [backlog](https://trello.com/b/gGyFYFId/nice-to-borrow).

Practice full-stack development
Apply what we learned in the bootcamp
Practice learning new technology independently
Showcase approach of development by using wireframes and user stories.
Practice disciplined git usage.
Open up the platform to my friends.
